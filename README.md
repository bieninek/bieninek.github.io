> It's my personal web page which was created because I needed to place somewhere a small info about me.<br />
> Live demo [_here_](https://bartosz-bien.github.io/). 


## General Information
- This web page contains some informations about me.
- I didn't create this project because of the desire to show my skills. I only wanted to place somwhere some info.


## Technologies Used
I'm not a front-end developer, so my project isn't so sophisticated...
- HTML 
- CSS

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. I will of course make updates because of phone number change, email change, etc.


## Acknowledgements
```"Anyone who slaps a 'this page is best viewed with Browser X' label on a Web page appears to be yearning for the bad old days, before the Web, when you had very little chance of reading a document written on another computer, another word processor, or another network."<br />
  -- Tim Berners-Lee in Technology Review, July 1996```
  This web page should work on all browsers. But I'm not a front-end developer, so it's possible that responsive web design sucks...
